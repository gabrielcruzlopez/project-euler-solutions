This repository includes Project Euler solutions written in Go. All the files
licensed under FreeBSD License. (see LICENSE for details)

Thanks to Go, most of the problems are solved under tenth of a second although
the requirement was 1 minute.

You can find the problems at:
http://www.projecteuler.net

I also add these solutions to a blog:
http://project-euler-answers-in-go.blogspot.com

The archive is generated for fun and practice. All comments and suggestions
are welcome. Some performance updates are done to decrease time not only
asymptotically, but also in real time. So, I sometimes sacrificed
readability of the code.
